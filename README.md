**About**

This project is a web application that allows users to browse films and people (actors/directors) in a clean, user-friendly layout. It’s deployed live at: https://v-films-people-ez.netlify.app/

The goal is to make film-data accessible, easy to navigate and visually appealing — ideal for movie lovers, researchers or anyone exploring the film industry.

**Features**

Responsive UI: Works on desktop and mobile devices.

Two main sections: Films and People — enabling browsing, search, and view details.

Clean layout for displaying film posters, actor pictures, names, roles etc.

Easy navigation between films and their associated cast/crew.

Deployed and accessible via Netlify.

**Tech Stack**

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3 (possibly Flexbox/Grid), JavaScript/TypeScript.

Framework/Library: (e.g., React, Vue, or vanilla JS) — [edit based on actual tech]

Deployed on Netlify — simple continuous deployment from GitHub.

Data source: (if applicable) e.g., The Movie Database API (TMDb) or a custom backend.

Version control: Git + Repository on GitHub/GitLab.
